To that end, a character can choose to gain muscle instead of fat when their diet and exercise calculations at the end of the day would result in them gaining weight, but only up to a number of pounds equal to the number of points of exercise they achieved, plus their Strength Modifier. For instance, a character with 20 Strength who undergoes 8 hours of vigorous workout, coupled with 21 or more diet points of food may choose to gain up to 13 pounds of muscle rather than fat. Any excess beyond the maximum amount of muscle gained will still gain the remainder as fat.

A symbol of the world's shifting views and understanding of the importance of the body and the embracing of its alteration, the Fleshbound are a mystic order that focuses on the manipulation of the flesh in combination with a martial art.",

They were treated as slave warriors, and inevitably, when their masters' power waned, they rebelled and formed their own order."

                "In a world where lipomantic creatures run wild, and the magic of flesh is a danger to the innocent, the order of the Sin Eater embraces this power as yet another tool to wield against the darkness. They empower themselves to literally consume curses and lipomantic energy, housing it in themselves in order to be repurposed into power to unleash upon their enemies. Sin Eaters act in a more supportive role in the world than most Blood Hunters. Where others would seek first to slay a monster plaguing a village, the Sin Eater first seeks to consume any curses that have been laid upon the inhabitants, not only to ease their suffering, but to empower themselves for the eventual battle with the creature that placed them.",
