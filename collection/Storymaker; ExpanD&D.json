To that end, a character can choose to gain muscle instead of fat when their diet and exercise calculations at the end of the day would result in them gaining weight, but only up to a number of pounds equal to the number of points of exercise they achieved, plus their Strength Modifier. For instance, a character with 20 Strength who undergoes 8 hours of vigorous workout, coupled with 21 or more diet points of food may choose to gain up to 13 pounds of muscle rather than fat. Any excess beyond the maximum amount of muscle gained will still gain the remainder as fat.

A symbol of the world's shifting views and understanding of the importance of the body and the embracing of its alteration, the Fleshbound are a mystic order that focuses on the manipulation of the flesh in combination with a martial art.",

They were treated as slave warriors, and inevitably, when their masters' power waned, they rebelled and formed their own order."

On a failed save, the target takes {@dice 4d8} bludgeoning damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal {@dice 4d8} bludgeoning damage to the target. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the spell's range, or if the target has total cover from you. Whenever the spell deals damage to a target, the target inflates with a number of pounds of blueberry juice equal to the damage dealt, and the target must make another Constitution saving throw. After failing three Constitution saving throws against this spell, including the initial save, the target inflates with enough juice to push the target to immobility and occupies the space of a creature one size larger than normal, though the target can be rolled easily. The inflation ends after 1 hour."

Crafted from a fragment of the raw essence of magic, shaped by the iron will of Narce herself, Arc Carver is a peerless weapon from whom the very first spells of Lipomancy were drawn, the inspiration behind the art itself. The weapon is too powerful in its true, unrestrained state for even Narce to wield indefinitely, and so she crafted it with layers of restrictions and suppressing power that can only be unleashed when one of comparable will to the Lich Queen herself holds the blade in their hands.",

Even in this state, however, the weapon is deadly, carving through enemies with an arc of lightning that leaves foes charred in its wake.",

At this point the weapon will go wild if not kept in check by someone of incredible force of personality, its raw magic lashing out, the essence of lipomancy both made from it and made into it causing wild transformation of living creatures within its reach.",
                "All of this, however, pales in comparison to the power upon its full release. In its true, untethered state, it scarcely even resembles a blade anymore, instead having more in common with a living bolt of lightning attached to a hilt, writhing and lashing about under its own power. At this point not even Narce can fully contain its energies, and the weapon lashes out at everything around it, chaotically warping the landscape and the creatures its power can reach, its sheer chaotic energy on full display.",
                "It is said that just witnessing this blade in its full potential inspired Narce, and just her momentary glimpse of its power lead to the development of the Flabshock cantrip, the very first of the lipomantic spells that would be drawn from the study of this blade's chaotic power over flesh and matter, life and energy. It is a weapon that even gods have taken note of, and its power has echoed through the halls of so many realms beyond the material, that the spells and abilities it inspired have been found in the divine blessings of gods and demons unto their clerics and warlocks.",

To that end victims will often go about their daily lives, obliviously being fed by the invisible fairies as they interact with others around them, unwittingly spreading the plague of fairies throughout their circle of peers. Some theorize that this is the means by which feeder fairies reproduce, as there never seem to be a shortage of fairies around to pick up the slack whenever a new victim needs to be fattened up.

But lipomancy is the art of the living flesh, and the combination of her prowess as a Lipomancer and her sheer power as a Lich allows her to conceal her true nature from most anyone. She does not even detect as undead to the senses of paladins or detection magic, as she has taken precautions against such methods.

The unique nature of the power she uses to fuel the transformation also means that her body does not decay: The magic that fuels her life force is Lipomantic in nature, so as long as she keeps a steady supply of adipose on her frame, which tends to rapidly lose weight compared to normal members of society, her frame remains as lifelike and youthful as any.",

She is able to leech off the adipose and fat of creatures, including herself, to supplant the life-force supplied by a soul. The inefficiency of this method requires her to use an immense amount of body fat, but it does allow her to extend her life-force non-lethally, to the point that soul consumption is often a last resort if she is low on energy.",

The energy transfer of creating fat on a target is not perfectly efficient, and she loses more energy fattening a target than she gains from consuming the fat. To that end, she often only uses the slightest of magical touch to induce incredible hunger and metabolism in her target, and allows them to fatten themselves to the obscene levels required to fuel her existence. However, this takes some time, as nearly 100,000 pounds of sheer adipose is required to make up the combined life-force of one average humanoid soul.",

Whenever one of these servants dies, or if she spends more energy than normal and needs a particularly strong boost, she will often seek out new servants from the particularly gluttonous members of the world. She is not particularly concerned with whether or not the creature is willing, however. She will make an attempt to persuade with words to conserve energy, and if that serves, then well done.

Notable among these projects is 'Project F', an experiment to see just how fat one living humanoid can get with all of the magical tools at Narce's disposal. An elf who has long ago forgotten her own name and purpose, and who exists at this point only to grow more colossal. In times of dire need, Narce can drain enough life force from F's mass to sustain herself for some time, as a mere 100,000 pounds of adipose is little more than a drop in the bucket of F's ungodly mass, contained mostly in extra-dimensional space.",
