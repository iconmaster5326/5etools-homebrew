To that end, a character can choose to gain muscle instead of fat when their diet and exercise calculations at the end of the day would result in them gaining weight, but only up to a number of pounds equal to the number of points of exercise they achieved, plus their Strength Modifier. For instance, a character with 20 Strength who undergoes 8 hours of vigorous workout, coupled with 21 or more diet points of food may choose to gain up to 13 pounds of muscle rather than fat. Any excess beyond the maximum amount of muscle gained will still gain the remainder as fat.

A symbol of the world's shifting views and understanding of the importance of the body and the embracing of its alteration, the Fleshbound are a mystic order that focuses on the manipulation of the flesh in combination with a martial art.",

They were treated as slave warriors, and inevitably, when their masters' power waned, they rebelled and formed their own order."
