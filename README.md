# 5etools-homebrew
Custom homebrew for 5e.tools.

## Prerequisites

5etools currently has a bug that causes everything to break unless you have all the homebrew's optional dependencies installed. To prevent this bug, ensure you have the following homebrews loeaded up into 5etools before importing ExpanD&D:

- Blood Hunter 2020 by Matthew Mercer
- Lingering Soul by Matthew Mercer
- The Pugilist Class by Benjamin Huffman

All the homebrew listed here can be quickly installed using 5etools's `Get Homebrew` button.

## Using

To add ExpanD&D to your 5etools instance:

1. Go to [5e.tools](https://5e.tools/)
2. Under the `Utilities` tab, click on `Homebrew Manager`
3. Click on `Upload File`
4. Enter the following address into the file selection dialog: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iconmaster5326/5etools-homebrew/master/collection/Storymaker%3B%20ExpanD%26D.json`
5. You should now have ExpanD&D in 5etools!

## Updating

To update your 5etools pages when this repository updates, delete ExpanD&D from the homebrew manager before re-following the steps above. This is done because 5etools sometimes has issues with re-importing homebrew multiple times.
