# 5etools-homebrew
Custom homebrew for 5e.tools.

## Using

1. Go to [5e.tools](https://5e.tools/)
2. Under the `Utilities` tab, click on `Homebrew Manager`
3. Click on `Upload File`
4. Enter the following address into the file selection dialog: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iconmaster5326/5etools-homebrew/master/collection/Storymaker%3B%20ExpanD%26D.json`
5. You should now have ExpanD&D in 5etools!

## Updating

To update your 5etools pages when this repository updates, delete ExpanD&D from the homebrew manager before re-following the steps above. This is done because 5etools sometimes has issues with re-importing homebrew multiple times.
